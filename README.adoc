= Lucky Chicken
Edward Harman <jaq@ethelred.org>
v1.0.3, 2021-01-03

This is an addon for Minecraft Bedrock edition. 

== How to Use

Download the `mcpack` files from https://github.com/edward3h/lucky_chicken/releases/latest[the latest release page]. There are two files, for behavior and resource packs.

On most systems Minecraft can now install the packs as soon as you download them or open them. If that doesn't work, check installation instructions at MCPEDL: 

* https://mcpedl.com/how-to-install-minecraft-pe-mods-for-android/[Android] 
* https://mcpedl.com/how-to-install-minecraft-pe-mods-for-ios/[iOs] 
* https://mcpedl.com/how-to-install-addons-for-windows-10/[Windows 10]

Create a world in Minecraft and make sure you add both the behavior pack and the resource pack.

== Lucky Chickens
With this addon, most chickens will occasionally drop random valuable items instead of eggs.

== Angry Chickens
However, a few chickens will be irrationally angry: they won't make any drops, and will attack players or certain mobs. Look out for their glowing red eyes.
